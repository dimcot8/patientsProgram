// I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

 While doing the milestones and the workshops of the OOP final project, I've learned and practiced a lot new for me. For the whole term, I studied object-oriented programming and many different and new topics for me, such as dynamic memory (allocation/deallocation), input and output operators, derived classes, virtual functions, abstract base classes, templates, and so on. Some of the topics were much easier to me than the rest, just like in any other subject. 
 As an example, in the final project, some of the milestones were easy compared to others. Personally, milestone 4 was the easiest for me as I had to code mainly based on created functions before (in milestones 1-3). The hardest ones, were, though, milestones 1 and 5, as I had to think a lot on such functions as getInt in the first one, and I had to change the code in the files from previous milestones in milestone 5. 
 I've also realised how important and efficient it could be to use debugging tools while building the project. While doing the workshops and the final project, I faced many difficulties and challenges when getting unexpected errors, which I could solve by debugging the code. The hardest topic for me in this sense, was file manipulation.
 In conclusion, I'm happy that I've taken this subject since it's really beneficial to learn. I'm looking forward to learn more about C++ programming language and to learn from wonderful professors like mine.
